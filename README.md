 Please find below my responses to your question.
 In the repository, you can find the java implementation of
 the particle chamber. You will also find the python version,
 associated using web service. The Json file is located in my github
 Json_files repository.



 This assement describes a chamber of particles with basic
 parameters :
 - the chamber is linear;
 - both of the edges are exits;
 - particles can pass through each other
 - all particles have the same speed.

 For extending the scope of the problem, we could model a
 multi-dimensionnal chamber and implement functions that describe
 the behavior of two particles, depending on the diferential of
 their speed, their direction.

 Not only it would be a more realistic physics problem, but it
 would also be an interesting statistical problem : the small hole
 theory evaluate the probability of an entity to exit a container
 by a small hole.

 This theory is wide used for biology problems, neurosciences
 particulary. But it is also used in the finance field, considering
 the price of an underlying as one moving entity, and the
 threshold it has to go over as the exit.
